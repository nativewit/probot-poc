/**
 * Secure execution and resource isolation (ticket 11, ARCHITECTURE.md §10).

 * Public API for the rest of the application (tool protocol, review engine,
 * admin tooling — and ticket 13's Docker Compose deployment):
 *
 *   const service = new ExecutionService({ prisma, execution: config.execution });
 *   const result = await service.runCommand({
 *     command: "git", args: ["log", "--oneline", "-5"],
 *     workspacePath, actor: "review-engine", reviewId,
 *   });
 *
 * Every command — allowed, denied, or failed — is validated by the policy
 * engine OUTSIDE the agent and audited in `command_execution_audits`.
