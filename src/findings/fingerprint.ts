/**
 * Deterministic finding fingerprints (ARCHITECTURE.md §7.3).
 *
 * The fingerprint is derived from:
 *   - the repository,
 *   - the finding category,
 *   - the code location (the file the defect lives in — NOT the line number,
 *     because code movement can shift lines without changing the issue),
 *   - the normalized finding description (case-, punctuation- and
 *     stopword-insensitive token signature, so rewording the same issue
 *     keeps the fingerprint stable),
 *   - the affected code identity (the normalized verbatim evidence excerpt).
 *
 * Same issue at different line numbers / with different wording → same
 * fingerprint. Different issues → different fingerprints. Fingerprints are
 * opaque (`fp1:<hex>`); they are never exposed to the model.
