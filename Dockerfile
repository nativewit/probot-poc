#   - docker CLI     : client for SANDBOX_DOCKER_HOST only (ticket 11) — the
#                      Docker socket is NEVER mounted into this image.
#   - opencode       : agent runtime CLI (ticket 06), pinned to the version
#                      the runtime was validated against. Downloaded as a
#                      static release tarball from the official release host,
